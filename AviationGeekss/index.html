                        <b>Airbus S.A.S</b>, an European Aircraft Manufacturer that established itself as
                        the world's second largest marker of commercial aircraft. Airbus was formally 
                        formed in 1970 by French and German Aerospace firms. The main Aim of the the 
                        Company was to compete with the long-established American Manufacturer of 
                        militarty and commercial aircraft '<em>Boeing</em>', by launching short- to 
                        medium-range, high capacity jetliners. Airbus launched its first commercial jetliner,
                        the A<em>300</em>, which entered into service in 1974. Airbus later became increasingly 
                        interested in developing and selling of military based Aircraft in the late 1990s and 
                        established a foot into the Military Aviation Market marking a huge blow to it's American
                        competitor.
