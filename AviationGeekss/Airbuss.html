                        with some excellent performance, the A<em>300</em> sold poorly.<br>

                    <p>The Airbus Logo over the past two Decades have gone through two modification.
                        Each of the logo design was based on its predecessor. Due to this, the overall 
                        style has remained the same.<br><br>

                    <p>The Launch of the company in the 1970s and with the first aircraft model,
                        Airbus had a round design representing the an aircraft turbine with two identical
                        halves broken into dynamic abstract pattern, symbolizing the Earth and the lines 
                        showing how the airline is the fastest way to get from one place to another.
                        <br> This logo made some changes in 2001 with the addition of the company's name

                        Later in 2010, The logo was restructured with a rounded and some 3D effect along 
                        with somme color gradient to the background. The Company's name featured a different
                        type, while still using sans but not being italicized this time. The two letters 'A' 
                        and 'R' were given some distinctive detail with some gaps left.<br><br><br><br><br>
                        
                        The last modification made by the company being used till date made in 2017, is 
                        flat and does not feature the rounded whirl emblem, only the Company's name with dark
                        and now saturated shade of blue which remains the same since date.

                <p>
                    The A300, was the first to be introduced into the family of Airbus, which came into service and saw the first light in 1974.
                    The Airbus A300 was specifically designed to be <strong>'wide-body airliner'</strong> to typically seat 247 passengers and travel an approximate
                    The first prototype flew on 28th October 1972. Air France was the first to place their first by ordering of six A300s in one go, follwed by Lunfthansa four option.<br><br>
                    The production came to a cease in July 2007 after it had <strong>successfully deliveried 561</strong> A300s. As of 2022 wikipedia 
                    stats show, there were 229 A300 family aircraft still flying routes.

                <p><strong style="color: #d46f03;">Variants and Dimensions;</strong><br><br>

                    Being the <strong>First to the Fleet</strong>, A300 family have many variants since A300 was launched with manufacturering name of <strong>A300B1</strong>. Since then, there have 
                    been a total of <strong>nine variants</strong> each with different technology and different Dimensions. In response to Air Frnace's demand for more seats, in same year of the A300B1, 
                    Airbus designed <strong>A300B2-100</strong> that was 2.6 m longer than its predecessor with increasing the seation capacity of 30 additional seats totalling to 281.<br>
                    The A300B2-100 had a total of another two sub-variants; A300B2-200 and A300B2-320.<br><br>

                    A new Variant intoduced is the A300B4, later named to <strong>A300B4-100</strong>. A variant with an increase of <strong>fule capacity</strong> and also 
                    featured Krueger Flaps which mounted on the bottom of the wing structure which results in increasing lift.<br>
                    A <strong>sub-variant A300B4-200</strong> had an additional fuel tank reducing the cargo area.<br><br>

                    <strong>A300-600</strong> intoduced in 1983, was a design longer than that of A300B2 and the A300B4 variants with addition of two rows of seats. 
                    A new wingtip was addded to the tips of the wings. The A300-600 variant was intoduced after the launch of the A310. The A300-600
                    only had one variant of its kind, but had multiple convertible-freighter versions specifically designed to carry cargo in bulk.<br><br>

                    <strong>Airbus A300B10</strong> launched in 1978, later called as <strong>A310</strong>, was designed on demands for an aircraft smaller than the A300s.
                    The A300B10 has a typical seating of 220 passengers in two classes or 240 in all-economy.
                    The A310 is 6.95 m shorter than the A300 variants. The A310 is the first in the family to intoduce <strong>two-crew cockpit</strong>, eliminating the
                    need for an in-flight engineer.<br><br>

                        five airframes and two major layers with oversized cargo hold on the top. The Beluga is a <strong>Wide-Body airliner</strong> designed to carry aircraft 
                        parts and outsize cargo. The A300-600ST have had many nicknames based on its massive body, iy received the official name of <strong><em>Super Transporter</em></strong>.<br>
                        The name Beluga gained popularity due a design resemblance of the Beluga Whale and has since been officially adopted.<br><br>

                        The <strong> Airbus A310</strong> program was launched 44 years back, initially going by the A300B10, the project for a <strong>smaller version 
                        of the A300s</strong> demanded by Airbus's European market was announced in 1978 and went on to continue the momentum for Airbus during its early 
                        days. The A310 came into service with Air france in October 1972. Airbus A310 was the first <strong>twin-jet wide-body aircraft</strong> manufactured
                        by Airbus Industrie. Later in 1982 a new prototype with A310 conducted its first maiden flight, comming into service in 1984 with Swissair and was 
                        marked as a strong competetor with the Boeing 767-200, introduced just six months before.<br>
                        The A310 was the first to have a two-crew cockpit and a typical seating of the aircaft with two-classes seated 240 passengers, or 240 in all-economy.<br><br><br>

                        The A310 has two basic versions each designed for short-to-medium range flights and for medium-to-long range flights, There was a third variant
                        just designed for short range flight, which was later never developed due to low demand.<br>
                        The A310-200 was the first to be developed and made its first maiden flight on 3 April 1982, later entered service with Swissair and Lufthansa a year
                        later. The production for the -200 variant ended with the merger with the -300 variant in 1988.<br>
                        The A310-300 first flew in July of 1985. The -300 variant has a much increased lift with the introduction of <strong>wingtip fences</strong>, making it a 
                        long-range aircraft.<br><br>
                        As of June 2022, there were 31 A310s still in services with Mahan Air, ULS Airlines Cargo and Iran Air being the three largest operators.
                        Since the end of production, a total of 255 A310s were succesfully delivered by the company.

                        The Airbus A318 a narrow-body, twin-engine aircraft was a <strong>Joint Operation</strong> between Airbus and Boeing as a
                        part of an agreement to share certain technologies. The first prototype made its first maiden flight in September of 1991. With A318 being the smallest
                        variant in the Airbus Family, with a seating capacity of 107 to 132 passengers. It came into service in
                        July 2003 with Frontier Airlines. Due to the size and seating capacity, it sold in only small numbers with a total of only 80 aircrafts being manufactured.<br><br>

                        Air France was know as the largest operator of the Airbus A318, and is the only type with <strong>zero accidents in the history of Aviation.</strong><br><br><br>

                        The A318 has no sub-variants, as it was a small, single-asile aircraft.<br><br>
                        The A318 was over six metres shorter to the A320, but with the introduction to a fin tip extension on the wings to the final design, making it
                        30 inches taller than the other A320s. The aircraft was designed with a seating capacity of 132 passengers in all-economy and an approximate of
                        118 with two-classes.<br><br>
        
                        With Frontier Airline being the first retired its last A318 in 2013. Since the engine and the body parts of the aircraft was marked to be valuable,
                        most of the A318s were scrapped down. As per statistics fron 2022, Air France and TAROM are the only two Airliners having 11 A318s and 4 A318s still in
                        service respectively.

                        The <strong>555 seat</strong>,<strong>Double-Deck</strong> A380 is one of the my favorite models from the aviation history of aircrafts been manufactured
                        till date.<br><br>
                        
                        The A380 was a project developed in 1990s, to challenge and try to bring and end to the dominace of the Boeing 747 in the long haul market.
                        The program designated as A3XX first started in 1994, with an esitame program cost of $10.7 billion dollars.<br><br>
                        
                        The Prototype of the called A380 was
                        presented in Toulouse in 2005. The full-length double-deck aircaft has a <strong>typical seating of 525 passenders</strong> with a <strong>maximum seating   
                        </strong> going up to <strong>853 passengers</strong>. Sigapore airline was the first in the line to be delivered with the A380 in 2007. However, Emirates now,
                        is the largest customer for the aircraft, having a total of 119 in service aircrafts.<br><br>

                        This model encountered many issues down the road with the size and the wingspan, it was harder for airports to accomodate a parking spot for this Super-Jumbo.
                        Due to insufficient space, most airline companies were restricted with using its A380 for smaller and tighter airport. Airbus announced it would end the production
                        of its Super-Jumbo A380 by 2021, with delivering a total of 251 aircrafts.<br><br><br>

                        The A380 has had a total of four variants, with three variants for the commercial market and the one variant designed specifically for cargo.
                        the A380F was the variant offered for cargo making it the second with the largest payload capacity after Antonov An-225 Mriya.<br>
                        The commercial variants for the A380 were, A30-900 or A380 Stretch, A380neo and A380 plus. Each of the variant were larger in size from its predecessor
                        offering better technologies and newer dynamics to the fuselage.<br>
                        The <em>A380plus</em> was a variant increased the life of the A380s by over six days more per year
